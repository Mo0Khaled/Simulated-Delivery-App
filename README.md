## Getting Started

a simple demo for delivery app, the driver marker will move from a starting point to the pickup point then goes to the delivery point and the user will be notified when he near or arrived

To make it work you need to do the following:

1 - open core -> endpoints.dart -> add your GoogleApiKey
2 - open AndroidManifest.xml -> scroll to bottom -> add your GoogleApiKey
3 - open ios folder -> Runner -> AppDelegate.swift -> add your GoogleApiKey

Annnnd -> Happy run, Happy Coding.
